netflix_clone

The "Netflix Clone" project serves as a cornerstone for developers who wish to practice and
showcase their skills in modern web development. By recreating a user-focused streaming platform,
this project not only explores the fundamentals of front-end and back-end development but also provides
hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and potentially other technologies.

Learning Opportunities

Through this project, developers can gain in-depth knowledge of:

Semantic HTML: Writing clean, readable, and meaningful code for better maintainability and accessibility.

Responsive Design: Utilizing CSS techniques like media queries and flexible layouts to create mobile-friendly experiences.
